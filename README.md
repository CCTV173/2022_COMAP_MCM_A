This work mainly focuses on the model building and programming of race energy allocation for road cyclists.

My teamates and I did the work together. We designed a novel algorithm to program the race energy allocation for road cyclists by using the Pontryagin maximum principle 
and viewing this problem as a convex optimization problem.

In this work, I was mainly responsible for the optimization model's establishment, algorithm proposal and corresponding code writing, while Shengbo DONG was mainly 
responsible for the problem 1's fitting model establishment and data analysis and Kaiyuan ZHANG was mainly responsible for the suggestions of the Control strategy 
and report writing.They both contributed equally to the drawing of the pictures.

If you get any problem, please don't hesitate to contact us.
